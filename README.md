# Lab49 quickbits: [React](https://reactjs.org/) + [Recoil](https://recoiljs.org) AtomFamily Sync Demo
This project is a quickbits showcase of Recoil's `atomFamily` API.
Often in financial applications we have many pieces of independent data that need to be updated rapidly and independently. This is a perfect use case for the `atomFamily` since it can dynamically generate unique atoms of state to be associated with a given ID. These unique atoms ensure that only components which are subscribed to it are updated.
